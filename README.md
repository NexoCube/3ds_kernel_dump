# 3ds_kernel_dump
3DS ARM11/ARM9 kernel dump by NexoCube

# How to use it ?
Compile it by running "make" or download a compiled version from the Release tab

For ARM11 : (it won't work on 11.3 until a kernel exploit is released)

- Run fasthax (or any other kernel11 exploit)
- Run 3ds_kernel_dump

If you don't run a kernel11 exploit before it will immediately return to Homebrew Launcher

For ARM9 : (won't work on 11.3 until a kernel11 exploit is released, or use a9lh)

- Find a way to run this on ARM9 (a9lh, or safehax)

# Where is ARM9 Kernel Dump ?
Coming soon, probably
